We analysed PURA's in vivo binding behaviour to RNAs in iCLIP experiments. Theses scripts contain the R code used to

## 1 Binding site definition and characterisation (HeLa, endogenous PURA)

+ Input: crosslinks in bw format, pureclip sites, Gencode Annotaiton (v31) as gtf
+ Output: crosslinks (bw_merges.rds), crossliks per sample (bw_all_samples.rds), binding sites (binding_sites.rds), filtered annotation (annotation.rds)

## 2 RNAseq changes in PURA knockdown
* Input: htseq count table, filtered annotation (annotation.rds)
* Output: deseq anaysis (deseq.rds), count table with tpms (rnaseq_counts.rds)

## 3 Characterisation of PURA binding (HeLa, endogenous PURA)
* Input:  binding sites (binding_sites.rds), filtered annotation (annotation.rds), crosslinks (bw_merges.rds), gff3 of annotation, count table with tpms (rnaseq_counts.rds)
* Output: binding sites with additional infos (binding_sites_characterized.rds)

## 4 Comparison of the crosslink patterns in three different PURA iCLIP experiments from HeLa cells and NPC PURA iCLIP 

## 5 Predict RNA accessibility and 5-mer frequencies considering mature transcript sequences (HeLa, endogenous PURA)

## 6 Comparison of binding to RNAseq changes

## 7 Shotgun proteomics

## 8 Reviewer figure: difference in proteomics results between ProteinDiscoverer and Maxquant

## 9 Overlap of PURA binding with dendritic transcriptome

## 10 Overlap of PURA binding and RNA regualtion to p=body and stress granule enriched RNAs






# Glossary

- crosslink site: number of nucleotide that has been found crosslinked to PURA once or several times
- crosslink events: number of crosslink events detected (one crosslink site can contain several crosslink events)
- binding site: PURA binding site (5nt wide) as defined in the binding site definition below
