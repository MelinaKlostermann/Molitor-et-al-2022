We analysed PURA's in vivo binding behaviour to RNAs in iCLIP experiments. Theses scripts contain the R code used to

* Define and characterise PURA binding sites
* Predict RNA accessibility and 5-mer frequencies considering mature transcript sequences
* Compare the crosslink patterns in three different PURA iCLIP experiments 


# Glossary

- crosslink site: number of nucleotide that has been found crosslinked to PURA once or several times
- crosslink events: number of crosslink events detected (one crosslink site can contain several crosslink events)
- binding site: PURA binding site (5nt wide) as defined in the binding site definition below
